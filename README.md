# Hello! I am Rosemarie Robertson

Most people call me Rose :) 

I want to make this README super awesome but here's the basics for now:

* My tiny personal site: [rosey.dev](https://rosey.dev)
* I write blog posts on technical topics at: [dev.to/rose](https://dev.to/rose)
* I set up [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/rosey) in case people want to say "thanks" ...but don't feel like you have to. I don't work THAT hard on free content/open source ...and I just do it for fun when I do!
